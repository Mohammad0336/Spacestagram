# Spacestagram
Using Public NASA API an image browsing front-end was made to resemble a social media like Instagram. The page uses a scrollbar to limit the size of the webpage, and to be able to display 5 photos synchronously.

## Functions

### Information state
This is the initial state of the webpage prior to any calls to the API it instructs the end-user on the purpose of the icons seen on the page.
